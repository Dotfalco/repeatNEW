<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

                                                            You are invited to participate in a psychology experiment. The broad goal of our research program is to develop a better understanding of information processing in human learning, decision making, and episodic memory, and how dimensions of information processing correlate and interact with survey measures of personality, emotion, and behavior outside of the laboratory. During the experiment, you will 1) complete one or more attention, learning, decision-making, and/or memory tasks, and 2) answer a series of multiple-choice and/or open ended questions about your beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in daily life.
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>
                                                            Only individuals 18 years of age or older are be able to participate. Due to the nature of the study, participants are also required to have corrected-to-normal vision, not be color blind, and have normal hearing.
                                                            </p>

									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> 
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
									allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the

								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
